Here's how you can retrieve the Jenkins initial admin password from a Docker container running Jenkins:

Steps:
1. Find the running container: First, you need to find the name or ID of the Jenkins container that is running. To list all running containers, 
	open a Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

	docker ps
	This will give you output like this:

	CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
	abc1234def56   jenkins/jenkins:lts   "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   2 hours ago     Up 2 hours     0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   jenkins-container

	Look for the container name (in this case, jenkins-container), or you can use the container ID (e.g., abc1234def56).


2. Access the container: Now, you can access the container's file system using the following docker exec command to open a shell inside the container:

	docker exec -it jenkins-container bash
	** Replace jenkins-container with the actual container name or ID from the previous step. If you're using PowerShell, make sure to run it as Administrator.

	This will open a shell inside the Jenkins container.



3. Find the initial admin password: Once you're inside the container, navigate to the location where Jenkins stores the initial admin password. The password is typically stored in the following file:

	cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
	This will print the initial admin password to the terminal. It will look something like this:

	6b3bc77ad10c465d9e687f4321e44f42



4. Exit the container: After retrieving the password, you can exit the container's shell by typing:

	exit



5. Login to Jenkins: Now that you have the initial admin password, open your web browser and navigate to Jenkins (usually http://localhost:8080 if running locally in Docker). 
	Use the password you just retrieved to complete the setup process.
