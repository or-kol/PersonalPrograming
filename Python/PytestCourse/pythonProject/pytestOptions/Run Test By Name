we have the -k flag in cmd which allows us to select the tests we want to run by name (it could be file name, folder name, test name etc):

this flag is not case sensitive which means we can't distinct between lower and upper case letters in the names.

**
--tb=no:
tb = trace back
when set tto 'no' - this option will cancel the display of the information about the fail.
it will display the fail itself, but nothing more.
**

pytest -v -k "options" --tb=no - will tun all tests, folders and files with the word 'options' in their names
pytest -v -k "case or str" --tb=no - will tun all tests, folders and files with the words 'case' or 'str' in their names
pytest -v -k "case or str" --tb=no - will tun all tests, folders and files with the words 'case' and 'str' in their names
pytest -v -k "xfail" --tb=no - will tun all tests, folders and files with the word 'xfail' in their names and all tests that marked as xfail.

** we can use not - and - or operators in this flag**
